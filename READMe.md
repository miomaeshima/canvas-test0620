## Test to get color data from image rendred on canvas

I set up a canvas element and render an image on it.
Then, prepared a function to get the coordinates of where the mouse is.
And, passed the coordinates to a function to get image data of that pixel.

This is for an enhancement for my personal project name-of-colors.
